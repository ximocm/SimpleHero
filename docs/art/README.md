# Art Notes

## Final Direction
- Minimalism is the final visual direction for the app.
- Visual priority is readability and clarity over decorative complexity.
- Asset quality can improve, but style should stay minimal.

## Done
- MVP GUI layout reference exists:
  - `docs/art/MVP_ui.png`
- Item/equipment icons are wired in UI and loaded from `assets/images/`.
- Transparent `VOID_BLACK` tiles are used in map rendering for a cleaner look.

## Placeholder
- Current item icons are placeholder assets.
- Character visuals are still simple markers/letters.
- UI styling is minimal by design and aligned with final direction.

## Missing
- Formal art direction doc for minimal style rules (color system, typography, icon language, mood).
- Final character portraits/sprites.
- Final map tileset and environment art pass.
- Final UI component skinning and state variants.
- Export pipeline spec (source format, naming, versioning).

## Asset Specs In Use
- Item/UI icon target: `34x34` pixels.
- Item/UI icon format: `.png`.
