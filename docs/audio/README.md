# Audio Notes

## Current Direction
- Audio direction is minimal for MVP.
- No finalized audio style guide is defined yet.

## Done
- Audio folders are prepared:
  - `assets/audio/music/`
  - `assets/audio/sfx/`
- GDD includes MVP intent: minimal SFX and optional soft background music.

## Placeholder
- No final music pack integrated.
- No final SFX pack integrated.
- Any temporary sounds used during tests should be considered placeholder.

## Missing
- Audio direction sheet (mood, pacing, loudness targets, references).
- Event-to-SFX mapping (UI, movement, door, combat, loot, etc.).
- Music state system plan (menu, dungeon, tension, victory/defeat).
- Mixing/mastering targets and normalization rules.
- Browser audio fallback strategy and loading policy.

## Recommended Formats
- Preferred: `.ogg`
- Fallback: `.mp3`
- Source/editing: `.wav`
