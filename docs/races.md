# Races - Base Doc

## Purpose
Define race identity with small, clear bonuses. Keep race impact lower than class impact.

## Rules
- Each race gives only small stat changes.
- No race passives in MVP.
- All races get `+2 Movement` in MVP.
- No race should be mandatory for any class.

## Race Stats (MVP)
- Stats used: `Health`, `Movement`, `Body`, `Mind`.

| Race | Health | Movement | Body | Mind |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Human | 10 | 5 | 3 | 3 |
| Elf | 8 | 6 | 2 | 4 |
| Orc | 12 | 4 | 4 | 2 |

## Future
- Add race passive abilities after MVP stabilization.
- Keep passives simple and easy to read.
